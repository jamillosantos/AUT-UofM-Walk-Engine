// Use the Ultrasonic distance sensors such as the HC-SR04 
// Typical ranges are from 4cm to 150 cm. 
// Connect VCC of the sensor to 5.0V
// Connect GND to Ground
// Note Library uses an Interrupt so is non-blocking but don't call sensors more often then every 10ms 
// as this will cause interference between different sensors 
// Connect Trig to Pin 8 and Echo to Pin 7, but can use any digital pins.
